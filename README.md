# _Arrays and Loops YAY!!_

### Loppty-Loop
* Learned about more complex loops that incorporate numbers and strings.
  
* We used these loops to turn strings into numbers and vise versa.

* We also learned how to incorporate previous functions into these loops.

---

### Array of Hope
* we learned about arrays and their uses.
* essentially it helps set a variable to be defined as a list of values.
* we learned how  to manipulate those arrays with methods like _.push_ , which adds to something to the array in the last spot.
